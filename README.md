### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate of App Academy coding boot camp.  It was very challenging to complete, but coding gets easier the more one looks at it, as you can see in the progression of my coding style.  I am pretty proud of how far I have gotten, having no experience in this field before joining App Academy.
